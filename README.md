# Performance Testing gRPC Services

This repository contains scripts and information about my presentation at the [gRPC community meetup](https://www.meetup.com/gRPCio/events/285842571/) on 25 May 2022. The presentation is based on the [original article](https://k6.io/blog/performance-testing-grpc-services/) with the same name by [@simskij](https://github.com/simskij). You can also access the Google Slides of my talk [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qW98MYIcDu2VSHyUBSWBI51ysg_qywCDBiaBXe65iJg/edit?usp=sharing).

The first demo is about a simple HTTP script to showcase how k6 works, while the second one is about two scripts, a simple one and a slightly more advanced one that explores more features of the k6. The recording is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvRb9fLcaYQ). I have written about the presentation on [my blog](https://mostafa.dev/performance-testing-grpc-services-3b2aa34c2a02).

I also included [grpcbin](https://github.com/moul/grpcbin) and [pb](https://github.com/moul/pb) projects as git submodules.

Also, to learn more about k6, please see the [documentation](https://k6.io/docs/).
