# Performance Testing gRPC Services

This repository contains scripts and information about my presentation at the [gRPC community meetup](https://www.meetup.com/gRPCio/events/285842571/) on 25 May 2022. The presentation is based on the [original article](https://k6.io/blog/performance-testing-grpc-services/) with the same name by [@simskij](https://github.com/simskij).

The first demo is about a simple HTTP script to showcase how k6 works, while the second one is about two scripts, a simple one and a slightly more advanced one that explores more features of the k6.

I also included [grpcbin](https://github.com/moul/grpcbin) and [pb](https://github.com/moul/pb) projects as git submodules.

Also, to learn more about k6, please see the [documentation](https://k6.io/docs/).
